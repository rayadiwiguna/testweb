          To help us comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, when you
          open your account we request a check up on information from Thomson
          Reuters. This portal keeps records of any positive or negative
          information on individuals (if those are official). This helps the
          Company to minimize any potential risks and keep crime out of betting
          industry.<br />
          We may also collect information from third parties such as our

          offer Services that we consider to be of interest, to maintain
          accuracy of the data, and to provide and improve the Services. <br />
          Sometimes we need to undertake additional checks to verify information
          or, once an account is active, to investigate activity that could
          indicate a risk. To do this we use organizations and databases which
          collate information and make it commercially available for use in
          crime prevention and detection, the promotion of safer gambling and
          ensuring the fair use of services. We also look at publicly available
          information to verify things like occupation status or property
          ownership, and at social media.<br />

          <b>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</b><br />
          We need to comply with a range of legal and regulatory requirements,
          some of which involve the use of personal information and/or set out
          timescales for which we need to keep that information. As a provider
          of betting services, we are regulated by the Gaming Curaçao.<br />
          We take our social responsibility and our commitment to safer gambling
          very seriously and we actively look for behaviour that may indicate
          that someone is at risk of problem gambling so that we can intervene
          at an early stage to provide them with support and direct them to
          sources of help.<br />
          To help us understand the factors that can indicate the early stages
          of problem gambling, we look at information about customers who have
          self-excluded, such as age, location and past betting behaviour, to
          identify common factors. This helps us intervene earlier in cases
          where customers may be at risk of problem gambling and provide them
          with better support.<br />
          We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to other aspects
          of our business, such as payment processing or complaint handling and
          some of these too involve the use of, or set timescales for holding,
          your personal information.

          verification, fraud prevention and anti-money laundering checks,
          validating the information you give against third party crime
          prevention databases and, where necessary, information from
          publicly-available sources. We share your personal data with
          organisations that verify details and transactions and identify
          potential indicators of illegal activity, which they make available to
          other organisations using their services. Where necessary, we share
          your data with Risk Intelligence agencies or fraud prevention
          agencies, which keep a record of that information and make it
          available to other organisations for use in identification checks and
          fraud detection and prevention. Where appropriate, we pass information
          to the police and other law enforcement agencies, debt recovery
          companies and other similar bodies.<br />
          As well as fraud and money laundering, we carry out ongoing monitoring
          to ensure that our products and services are not used for other
          Illegal purposes such as event manipulation, “match-rigging” or other
          forms of cheating. We do this in a variety of ways, including the use
          of cookies, and where we find transactions, data or behaviour that
          could indicate illegal activity we share information with third
          parties, including the police.

          organisation. We have a legitimate interest in carrying out these
          activities, and where they involve using your personal information we
          are careful to carry them out in a way that minimizes any impact on
          your privacy. Data protection law gives you the ‘right of objection’
          to the activities in this category if your right to privacy outweighs
          our legitimate business interest in doing them. You always have the
          option to exercise this right but, as we explain in more detail below,
          the activities involved are central to our business, so if you wish to
          do so it will usually mean you need to close your account.<br />
          Please read this section carefully and ensure you are happy with it
          before providing us with your personal information.

          <b>Business Insights</b><br />
          We carry out basic analytics to help us understand, how, when, where
          and why our customers use our services, and how our business is
          performing. This helps us monitor and plan everything from the
          effectiveness of our advertising through to ensuring we have enough
          staff available to handle queries at peak times. It also gives us a
          much clearer picture of our customers generally, the broad demographic
          groups they fit into (e.g. age group, gender, location, etc.) and the
          products and services they use, which in turn helps us to develop
          better and more relevant features, products and services.

            >Privacy Rights: Can I object to having my personal information used
            in this way?</b
          ><br />
          Like any business, we need to keep a close eye on how our business is
          performing and whether we’re meeting the needs of our customers. As we
          do this in a way that does not identify you as an individual, there is
          no impact on your privacy. If you don’t want your data used in this
          way your option is to not use our services and close your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Protecting our commercial interests</b><br />
          Most people use our products and services fairly, but we carry out
          monitoring of how our customers bet, play and interact with our
          products and services, to identify behaviour that is not in line with
          our Terms and Conditions or that could be prejudicial to our
          commercial interests.<br />
          At our discretion, we have the right to use this information in making
          decisions about whether to place restrictions on people’s accounts or,
          on very rare occasions, to close their accounts. We take this very
          seriously, and consider a wide variety of factors in making such a
          decision, taking into the information we hold about you as well as any
          information obtained from industry databases. Please note that we do
          not use cookies to obtain information for this purpose.
        </p>

            >Privacy Rights: Can I object to having my personal information used
            in this way?</b
          ><br />
          As a business, we have a legitimate interest in protecting our
          commercial interests against deliberate misuse, and we are confident
          that we do it in a way that is proportionate to the risks we face and
          has minimal impact on your privacy. If you don’t want your data used
          in this way your option is to not use our services and to close your
          account.

          <b>Things we do with your consent: Marketing</b><br />
          We will send you offers and information only if you have given your
          consent for us to do so, in which case we will contact you via email,
          post, SMS or online about any of our group products and services. We
          never share your data with companies outside our group for them to use
          for their own marketing. From time to time, we may team up with a
          third party to bring you details of a product or service we think
          might interest you, but where we do this the contact will come from us
          - we will never pass your details to the third party without your
          prior consent.<br />
          Please be assured that we do not use any sensitive information we hold
          about you (for example, information about self-exclusion, health or
          ethnicity) for marketing-related purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Keeping it Relevant</b><br />
          At BATERY we want to make betting better for you, so we want to be
          able to tell you about products, services and features that you will
          find exciting and relevant, and we tailor the offers and information
          we send to suit you. To do this, we look at what we know about you -
          such as your age, location and gender, your betting interests, your
          social media usage and how you interact with us - and we use it to
          build up a picture of you that helps us decide what you’re most likely
          to want to hear about. (This is sometimes known as ‘Profiling’). We
          also combine this with information we’ve obtained from publicly or
          commercially available sources about the things people with similar
          characteristics to you (in terms of age, gender, location etc.) tend
          to be interested in so we can fine-tune the offers we present to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Putting you in Control</b><br />
          We firmly believe our customers prefer offers and information that are
          relevant to them and their interests over general adverts, so we
          tailor all our marketing using this picture we’ve built up of you. We
          think this makes our marketing better both for you and for us.
          However, data protection law gives you the right to opt out of having
          your personal data used to build up this type of picture and predict
          what you might be interested in, so you can opt out at any time. As we
          explain above, all our marketing is tailored to you in this way, so to
          opt out of this type of personalisation you will need to opt out of
          receiving all direct marketing from us. You can do this when you sign
          up, by not ticking the box to opt in to marketing, or at any later
          point via your online account. We won’t then send you offers and
          information by post, email or SMS but we will continue to personalise
          your online experience based on the picture we’ve built up of you.
          This means you’ll continue to benefit from a more personalised look
          and feel on our websites and apps, and will still see the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Targeted pop-ups telling you about products, services and offers we
            think you’ll like
          </li>
          <li>
            Bespoke offers relevant to you, communicated through pop-ups or
            other on-site content
          </li>
          <li>
            Targeted messages on social media platforms such as Facebook or
            Twitter (which you can control easily through your privacy settings
            on each individual platform) and in other places on the internet
            that support targeted advertising.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We think this strikes the best balance: it lets you opt out of
          receiving marketing through offline channels (post, email and SMS)
          while still enjoying the best online and in-game experience and
          without having to miss out on bonuses, promotions and other benefits.
          However, if you prefer not to receive any personalised messages or
          offers online you can opt out by out by editing your account details
          via your online account. If you do opt out you will experience a less
          personal look and feel on our sites and apps and won’t get to hear
          about bespoke offers and bonuses. Please also note the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Some personalised banner adverts on our sites are controlled

          </li>
          <li>
            You may still see our adverts on other websites or social media
            platforms you visit, but these will not be specifically targeted at
            you.

          <b>Online banner adverts: cookies</b><br />
          If you have enabled cookies in your browser you may receive banner
          adverts on our homepage, as these are cookie-based and not tailored
          using other information we hold about you. As they are cookie-based
          you will receive them even after you have opted out of personalised
          marketing, but you can control them easily via your browser settings
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Advertising on Social Media</b><br />
          If you have given your consent to marketing, we will work with social
          media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to provide you with
          information about our products and services via their platforms.<br />
          If you do not wish to see these adverts, you can control this easily
          by disabling preference-based marketing in the privacy and ad settings
          on each individual platform. Even if you have withdrawn your consent
          to personalised marketing by BATERY, you might still see general
          adverts for BATERY products and services on your social media feeds.
          These will not be specifically targeted to you, and again, you can
          control this via the privacy and ad settings on each platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Marketing on our apps: Push Messages</b><br />
          When using our apps, you will receive push messages. These can be
          easily disabled through your phone or device’s settings.

          <b>Privacy Rights: Can I opt out of marketing?</b><br />
          Yes, you have the right to opt out of having your information used for
          direct marketing and the right to opt out of having it used to build
          up a picture of you so we can personalise our marketing to suit you.

          <b>More sensitive matters: how we use sensitive data</b><br />
          As a responsible provider of betting services, we do our best to
          ensure that our customers bet responsibly, and encourage you to make
          use of the range of tools available to help you with this. This means
          that on occasion you may provide us, directly or indirectly with
          information about your physical, psychological or emotional health or
          situation and talk to us about problems with gambling. We appreciate
          the sensitivity of this information and use it only to provide you
          with the support you have asked for and to signpost you to the
          appropriate sources of help.<br />
          To help us in our commitment to safer gambling, it’s important that we
          understand the factors that can lead people to self-exclude or may
          indicate the early stages of problem gambling. Where a customer
          self-excludes, we look at demographic information about them (such as
          age group and location) and their past betting behaviour and
          transactions to help us identify common factors. This in turn helps us
          to provide earlier and better support to customers who may be at risk
          of problem gambling. As well as ensuring we do all we can to fulfil
          our regulatory obligations, it helps us to help our customers gamble
          responsibly.<br />
          On occasion, you may provide us, usually indirectly, with other
          sensitive information about yourself, such as your ethnicity or
          nationality (for example, identity verification documentation or
          checks can reveal this information). It is rare for us to ask you for
          this type of information directly, and we will only do so if we have a
          specific and valid legal reason, which we will explain clearly at the
          time. Where we do need to hold this type of sensitive information
          because it is shown in an identification document for example, we will
          do so only to comply with our legal or regulatory requirements and
          will not use or make it available for any other purpose.<br />
          Where you provide us with details of, or a copy of, your passport,
          driving licence, national identity card, or other national
          identification documentation, we use it only for identification and
          verification purposes required to fulfil our legal and regulatory
          requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Other circumstances in which we share your personal data</b><br />
          Apart from the functions set out above, we do not share your personal
          information with third parties except where we are compelled or
          permitted by law to do so. These circumstances are rare, but may
          require us to share information with the police or other law
          enforcement agencies, the courts, statutory authorities (e.g. in
          connection with tax matters).<br />
          Where necessary to protect or defend our rights and interests, resolve
          disputes or enforce our agreements, we will share personal data with
          our regulators, external legal advisors and debt recovery and tracing
          agencies, although again these circumstances are rare.<br />
          If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a
          reorganisation or restructure, we will transfer your personal
          information to the new owner or successor company so we or they can
          continue to provide the services you have requested. The following
          measures can be performed only with your explicit consent.<br />
          Whenever we share personal information, and whatever the reason or
          circumstances, we will always do so legally and with due regard to
          your privacy. If we receive a request from law enforcement or other
          statutory bodies, we do not disclose personal information without a
          warrant, court order or other legally valid proof of authority.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>How long do we keep your information?</b><br />
          We hold your personal information only as long as we have a valid
          legal reason to do so, which includes providing you with the services
          you have requested, meeting our legal and regulatory obligations,
          resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.<br />
          The length of time for which we keep different types of personal
          information can vary, depending on why we originally obtained them,
          the reason we process them and the legal requirements that apply to
          them. Your personal data will be maintained for the period of at least
          5 years since the date of the last transaction made on your account.
          Your personal data may be destroyed after the period of 5 years, since
          a last transaction will pass and the approval by the Authority will be
          granted.<br />
          When setting our data retention and deletion timescales we take into
          account a range of factors including applicable regulations and
          standards relating to gambling, anti-money laundering, taxation,
          payment processing and complaint handling, the need to prevent or
          detect crime or other misuse of our services, and audit requirements.
          To fulfil our requirements, some of your personal data will need to be
          retained for a period of time after you cease to be a customer. When
          we no longer need it to fulfil the above requirements, we delete it
          securely.

          in the section entitled <b>Running our business effectively</b> and
          efficiently if you believe your privacy rights outweigh the legitimate
          interest we have as a business in doing those things. Please read that
          section carefully before getting in touch with us and note that
          exercising your right of objection will usually mean you need to close
          your account and stop using our services. If you disagree with our
          decision on this, you have the right to complain to the to the Office
          of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.

          <b>Your Right to Erasure</b><br />
          People sometimes refer to this as the ‘right to be forgotten’. Under
          data protection law, you have the right to request erasure of your
          personal data in the following circumstances:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Where the courts or our regulators have found us to be processing it
            unlawfully;
          </li>
          <li>
            Where our original purpose for collecting the data has been
            completed and we have no other valid legal grounds for continuing to
            hold it;
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Where you have withdrawn your consent to marketing and
              personalised marketing and asked us to delete the information we
              previously used for those purposes, in which case we will either
              delete it from our marketing systems or fully anonymise it, but
              note that we will retain your contact details in order to prevent
              further marketing;</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Where you have successfully exercised your
            <b>‘right to object’</b> to one of the activities in the section
            entitled <b>running our business effectively and efficiently</b> and
            asked us to delete the information we used for that purpose. As we
            explain in that section, exercising your right to object will
            usually mean closing your account, and note that in most cases we
            will need to retain your information for a period of time after your
            account is closed. We will not delete information as long as we
            still have a valid legal or regulatory reason to hold it, unless the
            courts or our regulators order us to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>How do I exercise this right?</b><br />
          Please read the sections entitled
          <b>‘How long do we keep information’ and ‘your right to erasure</b>
          carefully before contacting us. If you still wish to exercise your
          right, you should contact us at privacy@batery.com and we will respond
          to your request within a month and without undue delay. If we uphold
          your request and erase your data we will also notify any third parties
          to which the data has been passed, where we are able to do so, and
          tell you who they are. If we do not uphold your request, we will tell
          you why. If you disagree, you have the right to complain to the to the
          Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The right to access the data we hold about you</b><br />
          If you would like a copy of the personal information we hold about
          you, you should request it here. We will ask you to complete and
          return a form, which is not compulsory but helps us to help you by
          providing the information you are looking for. Before we respond to
          your request, we will ask you for valid proof of identity and once
          we’ve received it we will provide our response within one month. If
          your request is unusually complex and likely to take longer than a
          month, we will let you know as soon as we can and tell you how long we
          think it will take.<br />
          We will fulfil requests wherever possible, but there are occasional
          situations in which local or general data protection regulation (GDPR)
          2016/679 requires or permits us to withhold some information (such as
          where it would involve disclosing information about another person or
          information which is commercially sensitive) or permits us to make a
          small charge. If either of these applies, we will explain this to you.
        </p>

          <b>Your Right to ‘Data Portability’</b><br />
          The right to ‘data portability’ aims to enable consumers to re-use
          some of their personal information online by making it available in a
          commonly-used, machine-readable format that can be passed to and used
          by other organisations. This is a new initiative and it is not yet
          possible to ‘port’ data directly between providers in the betting and
          gaming industry. However, if you wish to exercise this right, you
          should submit your request here, and we will provide you with the
          following information as a CSV file:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the personal and contact details held in your online account</li>
          <li>your betting history</li>
          <li>A list of payments made and funds withdrawn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Before responding to your request, we will ask you to provide valid
          proof of identity, and we will provide our response within one month
          of receiving it.<br />
          If you believe your privacy rights have been infringed, or you
          disagree with a decision we have made about your privacy rights, you
          have the right to complain to the privacy regulator. As we are based
          in Cyprus, our principal data protection regulator is the Office of
          the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection.
