        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            2.1. When a Customer enters into an Agreement on Winnings, this
            signifies that the Customer has read these Rules and accepts the
            terms of organisation and conducting betting contained therein as
            established by the Betting Organiser. The Betting Organiser has the
            right to void the Agreement on Winnings both in full and in part,
            and cancel the results of Bets made by the Customer under the
            Agreement on Winnings, if they violate these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.2. The Betting Organiser has the right, at its own discretion and
            without providing reasons, to refuse to register a Customer, enter
            into an Agreement on Winnings, and restrict the choice of Bets.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.3. If fraudulent actions are determined, as per the Agreement on
            Winnings related to Bets/Interactive Bets, withdrawing winnings,
            choosing Bets and using forged documents, the Betting Organiser has
            the right to stop such actions and contact law enforcement with a
            statement about the fraudulent actions committed.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.4. All disputes and disagreements that may arise between the
            Customer and Betting Organiser shall be resolved through the
            established complaint procedure.<br />
            Any Customer claims regarding disputes are accepted within 10 (ten)
            calendar days after the end of the event that the Bet was made
            about. The claim must be sent in writing to the Betting Organiser at
            the address for official correspondence specified in Clause 1.1 of
            these Rules. The Claim must include documents confirming the
            validity of the request. The Betting Organiser makes the final
            decision on all disputed situations. The period for reviewing a
            claim is 30 (thirty) calendar days from the moment it is received.
            The process described in this section for the Customer to contact
            the Betting Organiser to make a claim is mandatory (pre-court
            dispute resolution).
          </p>

          <p>
            2.5. These Rules come into force from the date of their approval and
            apply to all Agreements on Winnings entered into from this date and
            all actions performed by Customers under such Agreements on Winning,
            regardless of whether Customers are aware of the entry into force of
            this version of the Rules or not. All previous Rules are considered
            void.
          </p>

          <p>
            2.6. The English language version of these Rules, which is posted on
            the Betting Organiser's website, is considered to be legally binding
            and takes priority over all other versions, redactions and
            translations of these Rules. The Customer, as well as other persons,
            cannot justify the emergence of any rights and obligations for them
            based on versions of these Rules that have become invalid. In the
            event of any dispute arising which concerns the content or
            interpretation of these Rules, as well as in any case where
            discrepancies or inconsistencies between the English-language
            version and any other version of these Rules are found, the
            English-language text prevails and cannot be contested.

          3. MAIN RULES FOR BETTING (ACCEPTING BETS AND WITHDRAWAL OF WINNINGS)
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            3.1. The Customer makes Bets regarding the outcomes of events as
            part of the Agreement on Winnings entered into on the terms and
            using the odds provided by the Betting Organiser in Sports.<br />
            The odds presented in Sports may change after the Customer makes a
            Bets, but the odds for Bets made by Customers earlier are not
            subject to change. Before making Bets, Customers are advised to read
            all of the information in Sports.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.2. Bets made by the Customer as part of the Agreement on Winnings
            and accepted by the Betting Organiser are not subject to
            cancellation or change unilaterally by the Customer.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.3. Distinctions are made between the following types of bets:
            Single, Accumulator and System.<br />
            3.3.1. A Single bet is a bet where you need to select one event.
            Winnings for Singles are equal to the amount of the bet multiplied
            by the odds.<br />
            3.3.2. Accumulator is a bet on two or more events (the maximum
            number of events in the Accumulator is 30). If at least one event in
            the Accumulator is lost, the entire Accumulator bet is considered
            lost. An Accumulator can include any combination of events in any
            type of sport. Accumulator odds are calculated by multiplying the
            odds of all the events in the Accumulator. Winnings from
            Accumulators equal the total bet multiplied by the Accumulator odds.
            The odds of winning are not limited.<br />
            3.3.3. If the Accumulator consists of at least 6 events, the odds
            for each of which are not lower than 1.60, then the following
            preferential condition ("Accumulator Insurance") applies: if one of
            the events is lost, the bet amount is pushed (settled with odds of
            1.00).<br />
            If two or more events in the Accumulator bet are lost, the bet is
            considered lost and Accumulator Insurance is not applied. If, in
            accordance with these Rules, one of the events included in the
            Accumulator bet is pushed, then Accumulator Insurance is not
            applied. Accumulator Insurance is not applied to options included in
            System bets. If several events in the Accumulator bet are cancelled
            and five or fewer selections remain, then Accumulator Insurance is
            not applied.<br />
            3.3.4. If the Accumulator bet includes two or more related
            contingencies (for example, a bet on a team winning a match and
            going to the next stage), then for settlement purposes, only the
            event with the highest odds is taken into account, and the remaining
            events are settled with the odds of 1.00. Events included in Combo
            are not considered to be related contingencies.<br />
            3.3.5. A System bet is a full combination of Accumulators of a given
            size from a previously determined number of events (the maximum
            number of events in a system is 16).
          </p>

          <p>
            3.4. The Betting Organiser has the right to restrict the maximum net
            winnings by a single Customer as part of the Agreement on Winnings
            for bets placed in a single calendar week to the amount of $500,000
            (five hundred thousand).
          </p>

          <p>
            3.5. The Betting Organiser has the right to limit the maximum number
            of Bets on individual events, as well as limit or increase the
            maximum number of Bets for a particular Customer without notice or
            an explanation of the reasons.<br />
            The Betting Organiser reserves the right to limit or refuse a
            specific Customer access to services offered without explanation.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.6. Prematch Bets are made before the start of the event. If a Bet
            is made after the actual start of the event, the Bet is cancelled.
            Live Bets are made during an event until the end of the event. Live
            Bets are cancelled if they are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>made on an event at the time it occurs;</li>
            <li>made on an event after it is over;</li>
            <li>
              made on an event, the result of which was known to the Customer;
            </li>
            <li>
              made on a participant (team) after they acquired a significant
              advantage (for example, a score change, removal, etc.).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            3.7. The Betting Organiser reserves the right to cancel the result
            of a Live Bet made under an Agreement on Winnings if the Betting
            Organiser suspects that the Customer had information about the
            outcome of the event or events for which the Bet was made at the
            time of placing the Bet.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.8. If the Customer agrees to a change in its odds or parameters
            (handicap, total, etc.) during the process of choosing a Bet in the
            Live section, then the Bet will be considered as having been placed,
            even if the score of the event changes by the time the selected Bet
            is registered by the Betting Organiser.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.9. The Cash Out option. Subject to the agreement of the Betting
            Organiser, the Customer may partially cash out their Bet under the
            conditions offered by the Betting Organiser.<br />
            3.9.1. In the Sports section, the final Cash Out price of a bet may
            vary depending on fluctuations in Sports odds, as well as the
            results of selections on separate events also included in the bet.
            The Customer can set a restriction mechanism that will be applied if
            the conditions of the Cash Out option change at the moment of
            rejection. A detailed description of the Cash Out option is
            available at www.batery.com.<br />
            3.9.2. This option covers the Single and Accumulator bet types. The
            events and bet types that have the Cash Out option available are
            chosen at the discretion of the Betting Organiser. The Betting
            Organiser does not guarantee that every Bet placed can be cashed
            out. The availability of the Cash Out option can be found out after
            the Bet is accepted by the Betting Organiser.<br />
            3.9.3. The Cash Out option is not available if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              all the events included in the Bet are over and/or the Bet has
              already been settled;
            </li>
            <li>the Customer cashed out the Bet earlier;</li>
            <li>
              during the refusal process, the conditions of the Cash Out option
              change, and the restriction mechanism established by the Customer
              in accordance with point 3.9.1 of these Rules prohibits cash outs;
            </li>
            <li>
              cashing out the bet is prohibited by decision of the Betting
              Organiser.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            3.9.4. If the settlement based on events for one or several
            positions in the bet has been cancelled for reasons described in
            these Rules, the bet cannot be cashed out and the amount credited to
            the Customer's betting account is deducted from their betting
            account.<br />
            3.9.5. The Betting Organiser shall not be held responsible if the
            Cash Out option is not available for technical or other reasons. The
            Betting Organiser reserves the right to not offer this option for
            all or several events, and for all or several Customers, without
            explanation or individual notification.<br />
            In all such cases, completed bets shall be settled in the standard
            manner.<br />
            3.9.6. Failure to understand the conditions of the Cash Out option,
            or the incorrect usage of the settings mechanism for this option, is
            not a reason for cancelling the result of any actions taken by the
            Customer in relation to this option.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.10. One-click bet (in mobile apps: One-click bet). The One-click
            Bet is an option that the Betting Organiser offers to Customers who
            want to make Bets quickly. The Bet amount for the One-click Bet is
            set in the Settings. By selecting odds in Sports with the option "Do
            not ask for confirmation to accept One-click Bet" enabled, the
            Customer automatically receives confirmation of the acceptance of
            their Bets.<br />
            A lack of knowledge or understanding of this option or using it
            accidentally is not a reason for cancelling a Bet.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.11. Free Bet option. A Free Bet is a free bet that the Customer
            can make from time to time by decision of the Betting Organiser.
            Free Bets can only be used for making Single or Accumulator bets.
            Funds are not deducted from the Customer's account when using a Free
            Bet.<br />
            In the event of a positive result, the Customer receives Winnings to

            these Rules, minus the Free Bet amount.<br />
            In other cases (a negative result, push, or cancellation of the

          <p>
            4.1. The date and time of the start of an event indicated in Sports
            are for information purposes. An incorrectly displayed date, time,
            or additional information (tournament status or stage, score of
            first match, etc.) shall not serve as grounds for cancelling a
            bet.<br />
            If the event took place earlier or later than the announced date,
            then Bets on such an event are settled according to the standard
            procedure as if they were accepted before the actual start of the
            event.<br />
            If the start of an event is delayed by 3 (three) or more days, the
            Bet shall be cancelled.<br />
            If the start of an event is delayed by less than 3 (three) days, the
            Betting Organiser may decide to cancel the Bet before the end of the
            event and inform the Customer of this in the official results of the
            Betting Organiser.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2. In the list of Events, the first team shown is the home team.
            This information is for reference purposes only and cannot be a
            basis for cancelling a bet. The following cannot be grounds for
            cancelling a bet:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the event is transferred to a neutral venue (the Betting Organiser
              is not obliged to inform customers of such changes);
            </li>
            <li>changes to the format of exhibition (off-season) games.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the location is displayed in the name of the sporting event shown
            in the Sports section of the website, and the exhibition status of
            the match is also shown (exhibition (between seasons) matches,
            exhibition tournament, etc.), the athlete or home team is permitted
            to not be listed first.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3. Interrupted Events <br />
            4.3.1. An event is considered to have been held if it was
            interrupted but played for a certain portion of the full time as
            regulated by the rules or a certain number of points were scored.
            For bets on entire matches, this is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Football — 75 minutes (for non-standard matches, 70% of the match
              time);
            </li>
            <li>
              Basketball — 35 minutes for the NBA (and other tournaments with
              48-minute matches), and 28 minutes for tournaments with 40-minute
              matches;
            </li>
            <li>Ice Hockey — 45 minutes;</li>
            <li>Field Hockey — 60 minutes;</li>
            <li>American Football — 50 minutes;</li>
            <li>Baseball — 5 innings;</li>
            <li>
              3x3 Basketball — at least 70% of the game time, or if at least one
              team scores at least 16 points;
            </li>
            <li>Other Sports — at least 70% of the match time.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            An exception is made in those cases when the score is tied when the
            match is cut short in sports where the rules do not allow for a draw
            (basketball, baseball, American football, etc.). In such cases, the
            event is considered void.<br />
            If the event is declared void, Qualify bets shall be pushed. If the
            event is declared complete, Qualify bets are settled based on the
            actual score when the game stopped, or are pushed in the event of an
            equal score.<br />
            If an event sponsored by an international athletics organisation
            (for example, FIFA or UEFA) is stopped and replay information is
            announced in a timely manner (up to 30 (thirty) hours), the Betting
            Organiser has the right to settle all Bets based on current match
            results.<br />
            Bets on separate parts of a match (a quarter in basketball, halves
            in football, periods in hockey, etc.), which have been interrupted,
            are settled if they were played for at least 70% of their playing
            time as set out by the rules for that part of the match. The
            calculation of actual game time takes into account only fully played
            minutes and is rounded down.<br />
            For example:<br />
            Stoppage time in an ice hockey match is 13 minutes 20 seconds. In
            this case, 13 minutes were played, or 65% of the duration of a
            period in ice hockey. This is less than the required 70% of regular
            game time for the period, thus, Bets on this period shall be
            cancelled.<br />
            4.3.2. An interrupted event which does not fall under the definition
            of a completed event shall be declared incomplete, if it is not
            played to the end within 3 (three) hours.<br />
            4.3.3. Bets placed on events declared not to have been held are
            subject to cancellation, except for bets placed on events, the
            results of which had been determined unambiguously when the event
            stopped ("who will score the 1st goal", "will there be a yellow
            card", Total Over, etc.). In the case of interrupted events, bets
            placed on the relative performance of halves (periods, etc.) are
            subject to cancellation.<br />
            4.3.4. Bets placed on events which were interrupted but still
            recognised as valid are settled according to the regular procedure.
            Bets placed on an interrupted match (game, competition, etc.) where
            the countdown to the draw has not started yet (for example, a goal
            between minute 76 and 90 if the match was interrupted in the 70th
            minute) are pushed. Bets made on events that have begun but not
            finished (for example, will there be a goal in the interval between
            minute 61 and 75, if the match is interrupted in the 70th minute)
            are settled as held.<br />
            4.3.5. Additional conditions for the settlement of bets are possible
            for individual sports if they are indicated in the corresponding
            sections of these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.4. If an initial result for a completed event is later cancelled
            (changed) for any reason, the cancellation (change) is not taken
            into account and the Bets are settled in accordance with the initial
            (actual) score. The actual result is the result announced on the
            basis of information sources immediately after the end of the event.
            A list of sources of information is available on the Betting
            Organiser's website. Bets on statistics are settled according to the
            specialised sources of sports statistics indicated on the Betting
            Organiser's website, as well as the stream and information from the
            company's representative at the match. The Betting Organiser chooses
            the source of information independently from among the sources
            indicated on the Betting Organiser's website, on the basis of which
            the result of the event is determined (Customer demands to use a
            different source of information, including information sources
            indicated on the Betting Organiser's website, are not considered).
            Sources of information for the purpose of determining the outcome of
            the events listed in Clauses 15.5.1 and 15.5.4 of these Rules are
            contained in Clause 15.5.1 of these Rules.<br />
            The Betting Organiser has the right to cite information about the
            source of information (specialised source of sports statistics)
            based on which the result of the event was determined, as well as
            the result of the event, by taking a screenshot of the screen on
            which the event is monitored, with the obligatory indication of the
            date and the time of the screenshot.<br />
            The Customer has the right to request from the Organiser information
            about the name of the information source (specialised source of
            sports statistics), based on which the result of the event was
            determined, as well as information about the result of the event, by
            sending a request in My Account or in writing to the address of the
            Betting Organiser with an indication of the event on which the Bet
            was made.<br />
            After receiving the Customer request, the Betting Organiser sends to
            the Customer, in the same way as in which the request was received,
            information about the source of information (specialised source of
            sports statistics), based on which the result of the event was
            determined, as well as information from the source of information
            about the event result (if this request is included in the
            Customer's request) within 30 (thirty) calendar days. The source
            used by the Betting Organiser to determine the result of the event
            takes precedence over other information provided by the Customer. If
            there are no results of the event in the information sources
            indicated on the Betting Organiser's website, or in specialised
            sources of sports statistics, the Betting Organiser has the right to
            use alternative sources of information, including information from
            its own representative at the match. If the source is clearly
            indicated in the title of the sporting event in Sports (for example,
            the streaming source), then this is considered a priority when
            determining the result. If an event is interrupted and played again
            from the start on the next day, the initial match is considered an
            interrupted event for Bet settlement purposes and re-settled
            according to Clause 4.3.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.5. The Betting Organiser has the right to annul (cancel) the
            result of a Bet in the following cases, but not limited to:<br />
            4.5.1. In the event of errors by personnel or software failure
            (obvious misprints in odds, discrepancy between odds in different
            positions, etc.) without the right of recalculation.<br />
            4.5.2. If the Betting Organiser is affected by one or several of the
            conditions listed below:<br />
            1. suspicions that there are unsportsmanlike elements in the
            sporting competition;<br />
            2. information from international organisations, sports subjects,
            other betting companies, and open sources, including the media,
            related to suspicions that there are unsportsmanlike elements in the
            sporting competition;<br />
            3. suspicions that Customers are acting maliciously in accordance
            with a secret agreement between themselves and/or any
            individual(s);<br />
            4. when newly registered Customers and/or Customers who made a Bet
            for the first time (at least 3 Customers in total) made Bets for the
            same outcome(s) of the event, if the total exceeds 100,000;<br />
            5. the atypical activity of Customers (starting with 3 Customers in
            total) associated with a large difference in the amounts placed on
            their selected Bets compared to previous selections (from 100,000)
            for the same outcome(s) of a type of sporting event on which
            Customers have not previously made Bets;<br />
            6. the Customer's ability to influence the result of a sports
            competition because the Customer is an affiliate of the organiser of
            a sports competition or acted on behalf of (had information) from an
            athlete, agent, coach, referee, team leader and other participants
            in the event for which the Prediction was selected.<br />
            4.5.3. In the case of the actual provision of access to My Account
            to any third parties or the performance of any actions in My Account
            that follow the advice of third parties. It is prohibited to provide
            information (username and/or password) to access My Account to third
            parties so they can make use of it.<br />
            4.5.4. If repeated registration is confirmed with the use of another
            person's personal data or ID, including if it is invalid and/or
            fraudulent.<br />
            4.5.5. In any situations involving any other violations of these
            Rules.<br />
            The Betting Organiser is not obliged to provide Customers with
            evidence of the occurrence of circumstances provided for in
            Subclauses 4.5.1–4.5.5 of these Rules serving as the basis for
            recognising the result of the Bet as annulled (cancelled). The
            declaration of a Bet being annulled (cancelled) forms an
            unconditional basis for settling a bet, in accordance with Clause
            4.6 of these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.6. If the result of a Bet is annulled (cancelled), the Bet is
            pushed, but if it is included in an Accumulator or System, then it
            is settled with odds of 1.00 for calculation purposes. In the event
            of the absence of reliable information about match results for more
            than 2 (two) days, the Betting Organiser has the right to push the
            Bets made on such an event.

          <p>
            4.7. If the results of Bets chosen by the Customer as part of the
            Agreement on Winnings are recognised as annulled (cancelled) in
            accordance with the terms of these Rules, then the result of the
            Agreement on Winnings in this case is determined by the Betting
            Organiser taking into account the provisions of Clause 4.6 of these
            Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.8. All current scores, match time, and other additional
            information displayed on the Betting Organiser's monitors and
            website serve only as reference information. The Betting Organiser
            strives to ensure that this information is accurate, but bears no
            responsibility for the consequences of Bets placed based on this or
            similar information. When checking the accuracy of Bet settlements
            including Live bets, the Customer is advised to contact the Betting
            Organiser with a corresponding request in the manner specified in
            Clause 4.4 of these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.9. The simultaneous placement of Bets, as well as Bets which
            bypass the established Bet or withdrawal limits, on the same
            selection by a group of persons (a betting syndicate, etc.) is
            prohibited. It is prohibited to re-place bets on the same
            combination of selections in cases where the total potential
            withdrawal payout exceeds the maximum established withdrawal payout.
            The Betting Organiser has the right to annul (cancel) such Bets.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.10. Any change in the score and other parameters of a match by an
            official referee's decision (for example, ruling out a goal due to
            offside, after a video review, cancelling or revising a point in
            tennis, volleyball, etc.) or the mutual agreement of the
            participants (for example, teams agreeing to play with an equal
            number of players after a removal, etc.) is not grounds for
            annulling (cancelling) accepted Bets.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.11. In the event of a change to the online text stream of the
            scorer or assistant, all Bets placed from the moment that the goal
            is scored until adjustment of the statistic in Live (Bets with an
            incorrect score) are subject to cancellation. In the event of a
            change of the scorer or assistant after the technical end of the
            match, Bets are settled on the basis of point 4.4 of these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.12. In disputed situations without precedent, all final decisions
            shall be made by the Betting Organiser.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.13. If technical difficulties arise, the Betting Organiser
            reserves the right to settle Bets with odds of 1.00.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.14. Sources of results when settling Bets are provided on the

          5. MAIN TYPES OF BETS ACCEPTED BY THE BETTING ORGANISER
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            5.1. A Bet on the actual outcome. Bets can be made on matches
            without taking into account the handicap if the corresponding odds
            are indicated (in the first position — a win by the first team
            ("1"), in the second position — odds for a draw ("X"), in the third
            position — odds of the second team winning ("2")). Bets can also be
            made on the first team not losing ("1X"), the second team not losing
            ("X2"), and on the match not ending in a draw ("12").
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2. Bets on each team winning the match with handicap taken into
            account. The handicap is determined by the Betting Organiser and may
            be positive, negative or equal to zero. To determine the result of a
            Bet on actual goals made by the team on which the bet is placed, the
            handicap is subtracted (if the handicap is negative) or added (if
            positive) for the selected team (the handicap for the second team is
            not taken into account). If the result of the match is in favour of
            the selected team, the bet is considered won.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event of a draw, Bets are pushed.<br />
            For example, if the first team has a negative handicap of -1, and
            the match ends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>with a score of 0:0, the bet is lost;</li>
            <li>with a score of 1:0, then the bet is pushed;</li>
            <li>with a score of 2:0, the bet is won.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If there is a positive handicap of +0.5 and the match ends:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>with a score of 0:1, the bet is lost;</li>
            <li>with a score of 0:0 or 1:0, the bet is won.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            5.3. Asian Handicap Bet<br />
            This is a type of handicap bet. Asian handicaps are handicaps where
            whole numbers can be quartered (1.25, 1.75, 2.25, etc.).<br />
            When settling bets with an Asian handicap, the bet is divided
            conditionally into two equal parts.<br />
            Example 1:<br />
            A bet on a team with a handicap of -1.25. Half of the bet will be
            placed with handicap odds of -1, and the other half on handicap odds
            of -1.5.<br />
            If the team wins with a difference of more than 2 goals, both halves
            of the Bet win.<br />
            If the team wins with a difference of 1 goal, half the bet loses,
            and the other half is pushed.<br />
            Example 2:<br />
            A bet on a team with a handicap of -1.75. Half of the bet will be
            placed with handicap odds of -1.5, and the other half on handicap
            odds of -2.<br />
            If the team wins with a difference of more than 2 goals, half the
            bet wins (-1.5), and the other half (-2.0) is pushed.<br />
            If the team wins with a difference of 1 goal, half the bet loses,
            and the other half is returned.<br />
            If a bet with an Asian handicap is included in an Accumulator or
            System bet, then when settling such bet, the odds used are the same
            as if the bet were settled as a Single bet.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If both halves of an Asian handicap bet win, the bet is settled
              with odds (K).
            </li>
            <li>
              If one half of the Bet wins in the Asian Handicap and the other is
              pushed, odds of (K+1)/2 are used when settling the bet.
            </li>
            <li>
              If one half of the bet loses and the other is pushed, then odds of
              0.5 are used for Accumulator bets.
            </li>
            <li>
              If both halves of the bet lose, the entire bet is considered lost.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            5.4. A Bet on the total number of goals, points, corners, foul
            shots, cards and other events established by the Betting Organiser
            ("More than - Less than"). The number of events indicated above is
            determined as an overall value called the "Total" and established by
            the Betting Organiser. If the Total is hit, the Bet is pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.5. A bet on a win in competitions or promotion to the next round
            of tournaments. If a declared participant in a competition is unable
            to begin the competition for any reason, bets on that participant
            shall be pushed. If two or more participants share a win in the
            competition, the winnings for each of them are paid out based on
            odds calculated using the formula К=(Kod - 1) ∕ n + 1, where Kod is
            the result odds for the participant and N is the number of winners
            in the competition.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.6. Bets placed on a specific match score and "Half Time/Full
            Time". In Time-Match bets, Bet Participants must simultaneously
            predict selections on the first half and the final scores when
            placing the bet. In the Pre-match section of the website, these
            outcomes are indicated by the following letters:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>"W" – win</li>
            <li>"D" – draw.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The first place is the selection of the 1st half, and the second is
            the match. The selection of the second period has no significance
            for the settlement of this Bet. For example, if the match ends with
            a score of 1:1, but the first period ended on 1:0, then the outcome
            "W1D" wins.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.7. Bets on the statistics of a round or game day. If at least one
            match in the round is declared not to have been held in accordance
            with Clause 4.3 of these Rules or was cancelled in accordance with
            Clause 4.1 of these Rules, then Bets on game day statistics are
            pushed, except for bets where results are determined unambiguously
            (for example, "will there be a 0:0 draw", "all teams will score",
            etc.). The Betting Company has the right to decide whether to push
            bets on round or game day statistics, if reliable information arises
            regarding the cancellation of one of the matches before the round
            begins. Customers shall be informed of this in the official results.
            In order to calculate the metrics on the first day of tennis
            matches, a player who does not finish a match (for any reason) is
            considered the loser of all other sets and games. Home teams and
            players are defined as the team or player indicated first on the
            event listing in the Prematch section.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.8. Bets on an odd or even total number of goals or points in a
            match. A score of 0:0 is counted as even.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.9. Bets on individual metrics or player (participant) comparisons.
            If a player does not play (does not participate), bets on events
            that involve such player are pushed. For participants that started
            but did not finish an event, metrics are calculated based on the
            actual result at the moment they are dismissed (leave), and for
            settlement purposes, such players are given the last position in the
            final protocol. Bets on hat-tricks are considered won if the player
            scores three or more goals. Bets on doubles are considered won if
            the player scores two or more goals. In bets on player metrics, own
            goals by the player are not counted. In bets related to team
            performance, own goals are registered as goals scored by the
            opponent. The bet settlement process for bets on player metrics in
            football is set forth in Clause 7.4 of the Rules. The order of bet
            settlement for bets on player metrics in tennis are described in
            Clause 11.3 of the Rules. In non-game sport types (track and field,
            etc.) and H2H type contests, if the participant (for relay races,
            the team) has started but not finished, then bets on them in
            comparison to other participants are lost. If both participants
            cover an equal distance or one participant did not start, bets are
            pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.10. Bets on the outcome of halves, periods, quarters, etc. If an
            event is declared unfinished, but the first half (period etc.) has
            ended, then bets on the first half are settled as usual, even if
            bets on the event as a whole are pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.11. Bets on the time when an event occurs, the total of minutes,
            for instance, the time of the first goal, the time of the first
            yellow card, the time when one of the teams takes the lead, time
            when scores are evened, the sum of goal minutes being less than the
            total, etc.<br />
            The ordinal minute in which the event occurs must be predicted. The
            precise time for calculating such bets is determined without taking
            into account seconds.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the time of the 1st goal if the 1st goal is scored when
            the time is:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>00 min. 10 sec. – 1st minute</li>
            <li>04 min. 10 sec. – 5th minute</li>
            <li>04 min. 59 sec. – 5th minute</li>
            <li>05 min. 00 sec. – 6th minute.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Bets on the minimum or maximum time interval before a goal in the
            match being less than the total.<br />
            The time interval before a goal is the time from the start of the
            match until the first goal, between goals, and from the last goal
            until the end of the match (excluding injury time). If a match ends
            with no goals scored, then it will be assumed that this match
            contained 1 time interval before a goal equal to the match
            duration.<br />
            For example:<br />
            If the first goal is scored at 11:01 and the second goal is scored
            at 15:59, then in this case the time interval before a goal will
            amount to 3 minutes (the 13th, 14th and 15th minutes). Only full
            minutes are counted for bets on how long a team leads/draw time.<br />
            For example: <br />
            The 1st team scores their 1st goal at 09:15, and the 2nd team ties
            the game at 12:40. In this case, the time the 1st team was ahead was
            2 minutes (the 11th and 12th minutes).
          </p>

          <p>
            5.12. Bets on metrics expressed in percentages (% first serve, %
            possession, etc.). For the purposes of settlements, values are
            rounded to the nearest whole number according to the rules of
            arithmetic and the source of information determined by the Betting
            Organiser in accordance with Clause 4.4 of these Rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.13. Bets on the value of one metric (m1) that precede another
            metric (m2). For example, "Number of shots on goal before the first
            goal", "Number of fouls before the 1st yellow card", etc. A shot on
            goal that results in a scored goal or a foul for which a yellow card
            is given are counted. If there were no goals or yellow cards, the
            result shall be the n1 stat (i.e. the total number of shots on goal
            or fouls).
          </p>

          <p>
            5.14. Bets on the highest scoring half/period of a match. If the
            number of goals/points in several halves/periods of a match is
            equal, the selection More Than One wins. All bets are accepted for
            regular time.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.15. Bets on goals scored on one side of the field. If no goals are
            scored, bets on "all goals scored on one side of the field" and
            "Team 1/Team 2 scores all goals on one side of the field" lose.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.16. Bets on player metrics. Bets placed on a player's statistical
            (or other) indicators are subject to push, if said player is not
            included in the starting lineup.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            6.1. Cricket bets are settled according to the official result as
            determined by the governing body of the match or tournament.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.2. If the match is interrupted and incomplete, bets on such match
            are subject to push, except for bets with an outcome that has
            already been determined.
          </p>

          <p>6.3. The following are the types of cricket competitions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              one-day international match (Twenty20, "short form") — the game
              lasts an average of three and a half hours
            </li>
            <li>
              one-day international match (One Day International, ODI) - the
              game lasts more than 8 hours
            </li>
            <li>
              test matches — the game lasts five playing days with a minimum of
              90 overs each day for each team.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            6.4. In the event that the official match result is a draw and no
            bet was offered on "Draw", any parameters to determine the winner
            will be taken into account, for example, "bowl off", "super over",
            etc. (bowl off and super over do not count towards other bets).
          </p>

          <p>
            6.5. In the event of a one-day match being shortened by 1-20 overs,
            all bets on the match will remain in force and be settled as usual
            according to the match result. In the event that a match is
            shortened by more than 20 overs, then bets are subject to return,
            except for bets with outcomes that have already been determined.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.6. If a Twenty20 match is shortened by 1-5 overs, all bets on the
            match will remain in force and be settled as usual according to the
            match result. If the match is shortened by more than 5 overs, the
            bets are subject to push, except for bets with outcomes that have
            already been determined.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.7. "Best team batsman" bet. The best batsman on a team is the
            player with the most runs. Runs in a super over are not counted. If
            two or more players have an equal number of runs, then bets are
            settled in accordance with Clause 5.5 of these Rules.<br />
            In the event that a batsman is out due to injury but subsequently
            returns to the game, the total number of runs scored by such batsman
            in an inning counts. If a batsman does not subsequently return to
            the game, the final result will be what was reached before the
            batsman left the game.<br />
            If the batsman is not among the starting 11 players, bets will be
            subject to cancellation. Bets on selected players who did not bat or
            enter the field are considered lost.<br />
            In limited over matches, bets will be subject to cancellation if it
            was impossible to complete at least 50% of a team's overs due to
            external factors, including bad weather, unless the result was
            determined at the end of the inning.<br />
            Bets on best batsman in test matches are only accepted on the first
            inning of each team and will be subject to cancellation, if less
            than 50 overs have been played, unless bet outcomes have already
            been determined.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.8. "Best bowler" bet. Bets on selected players who did not bat or
            enter the field are considered lost. In the event that two or more
            players finish the game with the same number of wickets, the winner
            is the bowler with the fewest runs conceded. The simultaneous finish
            rule applies (Clause 5.5 of these Rules). In the event that none of
            the bowlers take a wicket, bets are subject to return.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.9. Bets on any player not in the starting 11 players will be
            subject to cancellation. Bets on players who are in the starting
            lineup but do not hit the ball are subject to return.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.10. "Total runs before a wicket is taken" bet. The bet wins if the
            specified conditions are predicted correctly: taking the wicket and
            total runs. If a wicket is not taken and the total exceeds the
            specified minimum, the bet will lose. If the wicket is not taken,
            and the total runs exceed the specified maximum, the bet is pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.11. "Race to 10 runs" bet. Bets remain in force unless the
            announced players do not bat first, in which case bets will be
            subject to cancellation. Bets remain in force regardless of which of
            the announced players hits the first ball. If no player scores 10
            runs, the "Nobody wins" option wins. In matches affected by the
            weather, if no batsman scores 10 runs and none are dismissed, bets
            will be subject to cancellation. In the event that neither batsman
            scores 10 runs and both are dismissed, the "Nobody wins" option
            wins.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.12. Individual total runs () first () overs () B/M.<br />
            In the event that the selected number of overs is not completed due
            to external factors, including bad weather, bets will be subject to
            cancellation unless the result is determined.<br />
            In the event that the duration of the inning is less than the
            selected number of overs (for example, the team is dismissed in
            fewer overs than the specified number or reached the goal), bets
            remain in force.<br />
            Additional and penalty runs are taken into account when settling
            bets, regardless of the situation in which they were made.<br />
            In a test match, the full number of specified overs must be played
            for bets to remain in force unless the team is dismissed in fewer
            overs than specified, or the goal was reached.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.13. Individual team run total. This bet is settled based on the
            final score of the batting side. When a draw is declared and
            additional rounds are held (super over or golden goal), bets on the
            outcome of the match are settled only on the basis of the runs
            scored in the main part of the game. In matches with limited overs,
            bets will be subject to cancellation, if it was impossible to
            complete at least 80% of a team's overs due to external factors,
            including bad weather, unless the result was determined at the end
            of the inning. In test matches with a draw, bets will be subject to
            cancellation, if less than 60 overs were played, unless the outcome
            of the bet has already been determined.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.14. "Maximum number of runs of any player", "Player, total runs",
            and "Number of player runs" bets. In test matches, these bets are
            settled on the highest score in innings. Runs in two innings are not
            totalled unless otherwise stated.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.15. Over, bowl, individual run total. When settling the First Ball
            of the Match bet, only scoring balls awarded to the batter are taken
            into account. No-ball, wides and other penalty points do not count.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.16. Some types of bets can be settled only after the full
            description of the event appears in the official source, which can
            take 10-12 hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.17. "Best match batsman" bet. The best batsman of the match is the
            player with the most runs. Runs in a super over are not counted. If
            two or more players have the same number of runs, bets are settled
            in accordance with Clause 5.5 of these Rules.<br />
            In the event that a batsman is out due to injury but subsequently
            returns to the game, the total number of runs scored by such batsman
            in an inning counts. If a batsman does not subsequently return to
            the game, the final result will be what was reached before the
            batsman left the game.<br />
            If the batsman is not among the starting 11 players, bets will be
            subject to cancellation. Bets on selected players who did not bat or
            enter the field are considered lost.<br />
            In matches with limited overs, bets will be subject to cancellation,
            if it was impossible to complete at least 50% of either of a team's
            overs due to external factors, including bad weather, unless the
            result was determined at the end of the inning.<br />
            Bets on best batsman in test matches are only accepted on the first
            inning of each team and will be subject to cancellation, if less
            than 50 overs have been played by either of the teams, unless bet
            outcomes have already been determined.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.18. "Best batsman team" bet. When determining the best batsman
            team, the player with the most runs is counted. Runs in a super over
            are not counted. In the event that batsmen from different teams had
            the same maximum number of runs and a Draw bet was not offered, bets
            are settled in accordance with Clause 5.5 of these Rules.<br />
            In the event that a batsman is out due to injury but subsequently
            returns to the game, the total number of runs scored by such batsman
            in an inning counts. If a batsman does not subsequently return to
            the game, the final result will be what was reached before the
            batsman left the game.<br />
            If the batsman is not among the starting 11 players, bets will be
            subject to cancellation. Bets on selected players who did not bat or
            enter the field are considered lost.<br />
            In matches with limited overs, all bets will be subject to
            cancellation in the event of any reduction due to external factors,
            unless the result has been determined at the end of the inning or
            the team accomplished the goal or lost all wickets.<br />
            The best batsman team in test matches only applies to the first
            innings of each team unless otherwise stated. In the event that
            either side plays fewer overs in their innings for any reason (other
            than completed innings or Declaration is announced), then all bets
            will be subject to cancellation unless the result has been
            determined. However, bets remain in force if the result is
            determined before the reduction of overs.
          </p>

          <p>
            6.19. Alternative outcomes. These bets use an exact system for
            determining the outcome on a scale of points:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 point — for a run</li>
            <li>20 points — for a wicket</li>
            <li>10 points – for a catch</li>
            <li>25 points — for a stumping.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Bets on a non-participating player are pushed.<br />
            In One Day matches, both teams must have over 40 overs, otherwise
            bets will be subject to cancellation, except for bets that have
            already been determined.<br />
            In Test and First Class matches, the entire match is taken into
            account for bet settlement. In the event of a draw, at least 200
            overs must be played, otherwise bets will be subject to
            cancellation, except for bets that have already been determined. In
            Twenty20 matches, all 20 planned overs must be played and the result
            obtained from official sources, unless the outcome of the match has
            already been determined. In Gold League matches, all planned overs
            must be played or 5 wickets hit.<br />
            Point accrual:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>hitting a wicket directly by the bowler — batsman dismissed</li>
            <li>
              batsman not hitting the ball after bowling and catching (failing
              to catch) the ball by the wicket keeper — 0 points to the batsman
            </li>
            <li>
              after hitting the ball by the batsman when the ball is caught by
              fielders or the wicket keeper without touching the field — batsman

            </li>
            <li>
              after the ball is hit by the batsman and touches the field, if the
              batsman or non-batsman is not in the batting or non-batting crease
              — batsman dismissed for a hit wicket.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>For a batsman hitting a ball into zones:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>А — 0 points</li>
            <li>В, C (before the midfield) — 1 point</li>
            <li>В or С (past midfield to zone D) — 2 points</li>
            <li>
              D (without hitting the field) — 6 points, with touching the field
              — 4 points.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the ball hits first in zone B or C past the midfield — 2 points,
            and then in zone D — 1 point, a total of 3 points are awarded.<br />
            If the ball hits zone B or C before the midfield — 1 point, and then
            into zone B or C after the midfield — a total of 2 points are
            awarded. Dead ball (bowling the ball to the midline, including the
            line) — 0 points, the bowl is repeated. In the event of another dead
            ball — 5 points to the batsman.<br />
            Physical contact against a batsman — 5 points to the batsman.<br />
            Good ball (bowling the ball through the batman's zone without
            touching the batman) — 0 points.<br />
            Wide ball (the ball goes outside the zone or crosses the line of the
            batsman's zone) — 2 points to the batsman.<br />
            Leg bye (the ball hits the batsman's body) — 0 points, in this event
            the game continues. If the batsman and non-batsman change ends — 1
            point.<br />
            No ball (the bowler steps over the line, direct bowl above the
            wicket without touching the ground, bowl with a rebound off the
            field above the shoulder, bowl outside the pitch) — 2 points to the
            batsman.<br />
            Team (name) avoids a follow-on. It must be determined if a follow-on
            can be declared to the team batting second, regardless of if it
            takes place or not. Bets remain in force if both teams complete the
            first inning (including declarations), or bets will be subject to
            return.<br />
            Cyber Indian League 22<br />
            Matches consist of 1 inning with a maximum of 20 overs for each
            team. There are 6 bowls in each over.<br />
            There is a coin toss at the start of each match. The team that wins
            the toss chooses if it will bowl or bat first.<br />
            The batting team first accumulates runs for a full 20 overs or until
            10 wickets have been taken. The other team plays in their own half
            of the innings until they have more runs than the team scoring in
            the first half of the innings, or until all of their 20 six-ball
            overs have been bowled or 10 wickets have been taken as well.<br />
            The team with the most runs is determined as the winner. If both
            teams have the same number of runs, then a super over is played. In
            this event, the team with the most points in the super over will be
            declared the winner.

          <p>
            The winner of the match is determined taking the super over into
            account.<br />
            "Over, individual run total" — settlement is based on the number of
            runs scored by the teams, taking into account additional points
            (extras). If there is no over, the bets are subject to return.<br />
            "Will a wicket be taken in the over", "Will there be a penalty point
            in the over" — settlement is according to the results of the over.
            If there is no over, the bets are subject to return.<br />
            "Total", "Individual total", "Individual total runs" — settlement is
            based on the number of runs scored by the teams, taking into account
            additional points (extras) but excluding the super over.<br />
            "Who will lose the most wickets", "Total wickets", "Lost wickets
            team total" — settlement is based on the number of wickets without
            taking into account the super over.<br />
            "There will be a super over", "Winner in the super over" — if there
            was no super over, bets are considered lost.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            7.1. Bets on football matches are accepted based on regular time.
            Time added by referees to regular time is defined as injury time
            (not extra time, i.e. two halves of 15 minutes, which are used in
            tournaments and not taken into account, other than in specially
            agreed cases). Goals, substitutions, and other events that take
            place during injury time are considered to have taken place in
            regular time (first-half injury time is considered after the 45th
            minute, second-half injury time is considered after the 90th
            minute).<br />
            7.1.1. Injury Time<br />
            The total amount of injury time to be played is displayed on the
            stream via a special electronic board by the match referee. If the
            referee does not display the injury time on the stream via a special
            electronic board, calculation is made based on the report, and if
            the report lacks information about injury time, then the calculation
            is based on time actually played.
          </p>

          <p>
            7.2. For all bets associated with the number of player warnings,
            sending off players is not counted. If a player is dismissed for two
            yellow cards, one is counted. Cards shown to substitutes, reserve
            players, trainers or other individuals not participating in the
            match are not counted. Cards shown after the final whistle are not
            counted. Cards shown during half-time are considered to have been
            shown in the second half.
          </p>

          <p>
            7.3. Bets on which team gets the first warning or makes the first
            substitution. If the indicated events take place for both teams in
            the same minute based on match protocol, the bet is pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            7.4. The settlement of bets on statistics is carried out in
            accordance with Clause 7.11 of these Rules. The settlement of Bets
            accepted only during breaks, as well as Predictions, the acceptance
            of which was interrupted during the match, is carried out according
            to the information sources determined by the Betting Organiser in
            accordance with Clause 4.4 of the Rules. Detailed information
            related to the calculation of statistical indicators in football
            matches is available on the Explanation of Football Bets page.
          </p>

          <p>
            7.5. Bets on events to take place first in a specific period of game
            time. The event that will happen first must be predicted: an out,
            foul, goal kick, corner kick, offside, card (yellow or red), goal or
            nothing from the above list. Bets can also be placed on comparisons
            of various statistics, where a prediction is made on what happens
            first in a certain period of game time, for example, an out, foul,
            or neither. The calculation shall be based on the video stream timer
            on the TV channel, which will be indicated in the commentary for the
            specific match in the Prematch section. The timer in the Prematch
            section starts simultaneously with the timer of the indicated
            channel, and is considered the main timer for calculation when the
            timer on the television stream is absent. Data from sites, including
            official sites, are not taken into account in the settlement of bets
            listed in Clause 8.6 of these Rules. Complete information related to
            the calculation of statistical indicators in football matches is
            available on the Explanation of Football Bets page.
          </p>

          <p>
            7.6. Bets on "If corner kicks will be made from all four corners".
            This is a bet on whether corner kicks will be taken from all four
            corners of the football pitch - Yes or No. Details on the settlement
            of such bets and ways of displaying information on corner kicks in
            Pre-match can be found on the Explanation of Football Bets page.

            7.7. For bets on metrics before an event occurs, if the indicated
            event does not occur, the bet is not pushed, and the selection is
            calculated based on the actual result at the end of the match (for
            example, for a bet on "Number of fouls before the first yellow
            card", if there are no yellow cards given, the selection will be
            counted based on the number of fouls made by the end of the match).
            Metrics before the event occurs are counted inclusively, i.e. in the
            bet "Number of shots on goal before the first goal," a shot that
            results in a goal is also counted. For a bet on the shirt number of
            a player that scores a goal, the shirt number shall be counted as 0
            if no goals are scored.

            the goalkeepers are taken into account, regardless of whether the
            touches were shown on TV or not. If the moment the ball is touched
            is not shown on the stream (for example, a goalkeeper's shot is not
            shown because a replay is being shown at the time), then the time of
            the ball being touched is taken as the time the live stream is
            restored.

            For this bet, a prediction is made on what event from a specified
            list will happen to the player during the match. If a player does
            not enter the field on the starting team, bets on such player are
            pushed. The "Will play entire match" bet wins if the player plays
            the entire match and none of the other listed events happen to the
            player (no goals scored, no yellow card received, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            7.11. Statistical metrics <br />
            All bets are decided based on regular time apart from separately
            negotiated cases. For calculation purposes, substitutions made
            (according to an official source) in the 46th minute are considered
            to have taken place during halftime. When settling bets, a retaken
            corner is considered as one corner. The general statistics for the
            entire tournament, group stage, or specific team or player are
            determined by summing up the protocols of each match as displayed in
            the information source determined by the Betting Organiser in
            accordance with Clause 4.4 of these Rules. If one or several matches
            are interrupted and declared not to have been held in accordance
            with Clause 4.3 of these Rules, the statistical metrics of such
            matches count towards the total statistical metrics (for the entire
            championship, group tournament, individual team) based on the
            results when the game was stopped. If a team is disqualified
            (removed) in a group stage, they are given a defeat of 0:3 in all
            unplayed matches for the purposes of calculating position, points
            and goals in the group. In the absence of any statistics in the
            source of information determined by the Betting Organiser in
            accordance with Clause 4.4 of these Rules, settlement is carried out
            based on the actual result.

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            12.1. If a tennis match is interrupted, bets on it shall remain
            valid until the end of the tournament the match was played in and
            until such match is finished or one of the players declines to
            continue.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.2. If a tennis match is rescheduled (for example, due to
            inclement weather), bets on such match are settled after the rally
            (i.e. after it is played).
          </p>

          <p>
            12.3. In tennis, a player who does not finish a match (for any
            reason) is considered the loser in all remaining sets and games,
            with the exception of player substitutions. For example, if Player 1
            wins a five-set match against Player 2 with a score of 2:0 (1st set:
            6:0, 2nd set: 6:0), but does not finish the match, Player 1 is
            considered the loser with a score of 2:3 (1st set: 6:0, 2nd set:
            6:0, 3rd set: 0:6, 4th set: 0:6, 5th set: 0:6). In this case, all
            bets are settled based on a final score of 2-3 (the score after all
            5 sets: 12:18). If a player is removed or disqualified, or the match
            ends prematurely for any reason, the end time of the match is
            considered the time of the last point scored. Bets placed after this
            time shall be pushed. Bets on individual player metrics (aces,
            double aces, double faults, breaks, etc.) shall be settled based on
            the metrics when the match stops. Bets placed on specific sets or
            games are pushed if no points were scored in the set or game. The
            handicap and total in tennis matches are calculated by games (in
            volleyball matches, by points). When settling bets, a tie-break is
            considered as one game. If the decisive set was a super tie-break
            (up to 10 points), then the score in such a set is determined by the
            number of points, for example, when the score is 2:1 (3:6; 7:6;
            10:8) the result of the match by games is 20:20.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.4. "Two points in a row" Bets. In the event of the withdrawal or
            disqualification of one of the tennis players or their refusal to
            continue playing, the bet is settled in accordance with Clause 12.3
            of the Terms and Conditions, but if at least one point specified in
            the bets has been rallied, then such bets are subject to
            settlement.<br />
            For example:<br />
            Bets on outcomes "Game 2: point 2 and point 3", "Game 2: point 3 and
            point 4", "Game 2: point 4 and point 5", and "Game 3: point 1 and
            point 2" have been accepted. The first tennis player is removed from
            the match when the score is 0:0 (1:0) 40:0.<br />
            In this case:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>bet "Game 2: point 2 and point 3" is settled</li>
            <li>bet "Game 2: point 3 and point 4" is settled</li>
            <li>
              bets for "Game 2: point 4 and point 5" and "Game 3: point 1 and
              point 2" are pushed, because in the second and third games the
              specified rallies were not started prior to the removal of the
              tennis player.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            12.5. If the number of sets in a match is shown incorrectly, bets on
            the score in sets, total, and handicap are pushed. In this case,
            bets on the match selection shall not be pushed.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.6. Incorrectly or imprecisely indicated types of coverage,
            tournament name or tournament location shall not serve as a basis
            for cancelling bets.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.7. When settling bets, any additional sets (for example, extra
            sets, gold sets) are not counted.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.8. In volleyball, the decisive 5th set (in beach volleyball, the
            3rd set) is not considered a tie-break, but rather a regular set,
            and is taken into account for settling bets in the usual manner,
            including "Total of the highest scoring set" and "Total of the
            lowest scoring set" bets. In "The score will be balanced" ("Yes" or
            "No") volleyball bets, balance is considered the evening of the
            score after the first set point in the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.9. Bets on aces in volleyball. An ace in volleyball is a serve
            after which:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the ball lands in the opponent's court without contacting the
              players of the receiving team;
            </li>
            <li>
              the ball is out of play after contact with only one player of the
              receiving team;
            </li>
            <li>
              after the ball makes contact with the second player, the ball does
              not fly towards the opposing team and lands out of play.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If the ball touches all players from the opposing team in a row, it
            is not considered an ace. The calculation of the number of aces is
            based on the stream.<br />
            Bets on the number of blocks in volleyball. The calculation of the
            number of blocks is based on the stream. If there is no stream, the
            calculation is based on the data available on the official
            tournament website.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.10. If during an exhibition game an event occurs which, according
            to volleyball rules, ends the match, e.g. a team wins with a score
            of 3:1 or 3:1, after which the winner is unambiguously determined,
            then bets are settled on the basis of this event even if the teams
            continue playing. Further events do not affect the settlement of
            bets, but will be settled as separate events if available for Live
            betting.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.11. The rules for settling tennis and volleyball bets apply for
            the following sports: badminton, table tennis, squash, beach
            volleyball, mixed volleyball and billiards.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.12. Matches of Russia-wide and regional sporting events sponsored
            by the Russian Table Tennis Federation (RTTF) are played with 5 and
            7 sets.<br />
            In the first 4 and 6 sets, with a score of 10:10 the winner is the
            player who scores the 11th point.<br />
            The 5th and 7th sets are played to 7 points. If neither team scores
            a total of 10 points after 7 minutes in the decisive set, to speed
            up the game, the rules change so that each server serves only one
            point.
          </p>

          <p>
            12.13. Ping-pong rules. All players must use official rackets with
            authorised covering materials. Matches are decided by best of 3
            sets. All sets are played to 15 points. A set ends if the score is
            15-14. All other situations are governed by the rules of table
            tennis.

            Bets on selections of the first innings and match as a whole

            controlled by the player, and do not gain experience, if the creep
            was controlled by the player. You can only deny an ally if their
